I found the source from http://cheatengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5477214&sid=00a71666ea27fea14168c6d158f69724 (http://www.mediafire.com/?ruulm32z36i5dff), and modify it for squirrel3 compatible.

## PS:
This program work `only` on `standard` squirrel nut file.
Please note that squirrel is an open source script language, the user can modify the compiler result in there want.
The modify may include but not only: encrypt the string and bytecode, add a custom op code, ... ect.

## PS2:
The file "SQuirrelCNut.bt" is a template can use in 010Editor that help you explore the file struct.
